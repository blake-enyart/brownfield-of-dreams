# Brownfield Of Dreams

This is the final project which was built starting from a brownfield project used at Turing for Backend Mod 3.

The original brownfield code base can be referred to in the Github repo [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams).

Project Spec and Evaluation Rubric: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams

### Project Requirements

Students build on the existing code base using the cards within the following Github Project: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams/projects/1

### About the Project

This is a Ruby on Rails application used to organize YouTube content used for online learning. Each tutorial is a playlist of video segments. Within the application an admin is able to create tags for each tutorial in the database. A visitor or registered user can then filter tutorials based on these tags.

A visitor is able to see all of the content on the application but in order to bookmark a segment they will need to register. Once registered a user can bookmark any of the segments in a tutorial page.

## Local Setup


Clone down the repo
```
git clone
```

Install the gem packages
```
bundle install
```

Install node packages for stimulus
```
brew install node
brew install yarn
yarn add stimulus
```

Next, you'll need to generate and integrate a YouTube API key into the app as follows:

 * Visit [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) and follow the steps to create a project.
 
 * Return to the [YouTube API key - Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started), click on `obtain authorization credentials`, then `Credentials page`, and create credentials for the YouTube API just generated. 
 
  **Note**: Make sure to enable the `YouTube Data API v3` API for the project and generate an API key NOT an OAuth 2.0 credential

 * Use the `figaro` gem to generate an `application.yml` as follows:
 ```
 bundle exec figaro install
 ```
 * Open the `config/application.yml` that was just generated in an editor
 
 * Copy the key generated earlier and paste that key in the `application.yml` in the following format:
 ```
 #config/application.yml
 
 YOUTUBE_API_KEY: '<YouTube generated API key>'
 ```

After you setup the API key, setup the database
```
rake db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}
```

Run the test suite:
```
bundle exec rspec
```
